ASSISTANT RESPONSE
==================
Here’s what’s in the uploaded zip and what the project does.

What this project is
--------------------
RustDirNav is a small Rust library crate (rust_dir_nav, v1.1.0, Rust 2018 edition) that performs
a depth-first traversal (DFS) of a directory tree and calls back into an application-defined
handler whenever it encounters:
- a directory (do_dir)
- a file (do_file)

That handler is supplied via a generic type parameter constrained by the DirEvent trait.

Project layout
--------------
- Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock
- src/lib.rs — library implementation
- examples/test1.rs — demo program
- test_dir/ — test directory tree
- README.md, RustDirNav.md, Output.txt
- Pictures/ — screenshots
- *.rs.html — rendered HTML source

Core API
--------
The DirEvent trait defines callbacks:
  fn do_dir(&mut self, d: &str);
  fn do_file(&mut self, f: &str);

DirNav<App> manages:
- file-extension patterns
- recursion and visibility options
- directory and file counters

Traversal behavior
------------------
The visit method performs a depth-first traversal, filtering files by extension, invoking
callbacks, and optionally recursing into subdirectories.

Demo and tests
--------------
The example program demonstrates usage and reports counts. Unit tests validate traversal,
pattern handling, and clear behavior.

Code metrics
------------
- src/lib.rs: ~258 lines
- examples/test1.rs: ~77 lines
- visit() is the most complex function (~10 brace complexity)

Observations
------------
- Uses bitwise OR (|) instead of logical OR (||) for booleans
- Path handling could rely more on PathBuf instead of string replacement
- Extension matching is case-sensitive

Overall
-------
The project cleanly separates traversal logic from application behavior and serves as both
a practical utility and a clear instructional example.
