        Hi, I&apos;m Jim Fawcett.  I enjoy talking about and developing software. This is my site and I&apos;m glad
        you stopped by.
        The site is intended for anyone interested in software development, especially for developers using C++, Rust,
        or C#. All are welcome.
      </t-b>
      <t-b style="margin-top:1em;">

          <hr />
          <t-b>
            I am building this site to learn about things that interest me and provide reference
            and learning materials for others.
            Code here is exploratory and/or expository. I make no claims of fitness for production.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            I think most of what you see here is correct, clearly stated, and follows accepted idioms.
            The earliest material may not always be so, but I do go back to make improvements.
            You can help by advising me
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JimFawcett/JimFawcett.github.io/discussions/5">here</a>
            of needed improvements.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            None of the texts or codes displayed in this site have been generated by AI assistants. I do use 
            ChatGPT to discover bits of syntax that are not well documented and to help debug small bits of
            code, especially for JavaScript that implements much of the user functionality of the site.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Also, ChatGPT has proven useful for generating regular expressions and listing all the options
            for terminal commands.
          </t-b>

      <t-b>
        This site is all about code: Repositories, Stories with examples, Bites that focus on language
        features, and bits that compare several programming languages.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mwcorley79">Mike Corley</a> for many reviews and suggestions that have helped improve
        this site.

    <note-block>
      You are looking at a new version of the <a target="_blank" href="../JimFawcett.github.io/index.html">first site</a> I built to learn Rust by trying to
      explain how it works. That had fairly complete content, but was too hard to use and some contents
      needed simpler explanations.
      <sp-small></sp-small>
      This site is simpler to use, but is very much a work in progress with missing links and only has
      bits and pieces of content. Porting and simplifying material from the first site will happen
      as quickly as time permits.

        Much of this site&apos;s contents are &quot;Stories&quot;, &quot;Bites&quot;, &quot;Bits&quot; and
        &quot;Repositories&quot;. Each of these are implemented as
        <a target="_blank" href="SiteMap.html#threads">threads</a>, e.g., a linked list of pages traversed with
        &quot;Prev&quot;, &quot;Next&quot;, and &quot;Pages&quot; menu buttons.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        <strong>Stories</strong> are narratives about a programming language or other technical topic.
        Think of them as ebooks that give a reasonably thorough presentation of topic details
        in a series of linked pages, one for each chapter.
      </t-b>
      <div class="clears" style="width:calc(100vw - 7rem);">
        <badge-container class="left" style="margin-right:1rem; margin-bottom:0.75rem;">
          <a class="light badge" target="_blank" href="RustStoryRepo.html" style="text-decoration:none;">
            Rust&nbsp;Story&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </a>
        </badge-container>
        <t-b>
          The Rust Story consists of seven chapters, with each chapter presented on one page.
          For example, the <a target="_blank" href="RustStory_Models.html">Models chapter</a> provides an overview of Rust&apos;s
          code structure, process for building, ownership, user-defined types and Traits, and Generics. And provides
          exercises and references at the end. After studying this chapter you will be able to begin writing
          useful code with Rust.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          There are other stories which you can access from the &quot;Stories&quot;
          dropdown in the top menu, and can also be reached from links in the
          <a target="_blank" href="SiteMap.html">SiteMap</a>.

      </div>
      <div style="clear:left;">
        <t-b>
          A <strong>Bite</strong> is a single web page focused on one feature of a language or platform.
          Bites are
          linked into a thread using <strongs>Prev</strongs> and <strongs>Next</strongs> links, so the thread
          covers important parts of its parent story and is easily navigated.
        </t-b>
        <t-b class="clears">
          <badge-container class="left" style="margin-right:1rem; margin-bottom:0.75rem;">

          </badge-container>
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          Rust Bites divide each story chapter into a few Bites, each focused on an important topic in the chapter,
          and linked together. For example the <a target="_blank" href="Resources/RustBites/RustBites_Data.html">Data bite</a>
          covers operations: bind, copy, borrow, move, clone, and mutate, with conclusions and exercises at the end.
          Bytes provide more details or a different point of view than the
          story chapter, so that makes an expanded narrative from easy to digest pieces.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          There are Bites for most of the Tracks, accessible from the &quot;Tracks&quot; dropdown in the
          top menu and from the SiteMap.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          <strong>Bits</strong> are relatively small compilable codes written in several languages: C++,
          Rust, C#, Python, and JavaScript. Bits allow you to compare two languages by comparing their
          code fragments and resulting outputs.
        </t-b>
        <t-b class="clears">
          <badge-container class="left" style="margin-right:1rem; margin-bottom:0.75rem;">

          </badge-container>
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          Bits provide step-by-step instructions for setting up tool chains for building, running,
          and debugging code in each of the languages.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          They also provide levels of code examples, for each of the languages, that help you understand
          the language type systems, user-defined types, and common operations. For example,
          <a target="_blank" href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/Resources/Bits/Bits_DataRust.html">Bits_DataRust</a>
          and <a target="_blank" href="https://jimfawcett.github.io/Resources/Bits/Bits_DataCpp.html">Bits_DataCpp</a>.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          <strong>Repositories</strong> are containers for code and documentation, available from the
          &quot;Repos&quot; drop-down on the top menu. There are repository collections for C++, Rust,
          C#, JavaScript, and Other. Each member of a collection is a documentation webpage that links
          to a github repository containing code.
        </t-b>
        <div class="clears" style="width:calc(100vw - 7rem);">
          <badge-container class="left" style="margin-right:1rem; margin-bottom:0.75rem;">

            </a>
          </badge-container>
          <t-b>
            The Rust collection contains tools, components, libraries, projects, and demos. For
            example, the components contain a repository for a <a target="_blank" href="RustThreadPool.html">thread pool</a> written in Rust.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            You will find many small C++ and Rust demonstration programs in the &quot;Dems&quot; drop-downs.
            All of the curated code is available from the &quot;Repos&quot; dropdown in the top menu.
          </t-b>
        </div>
        <t-b>
          Most repositories have a documentation web page
          that discusses its code and links to a github repository with the code.
          Essentially, repositories in this site are proxies for the actual code in a github repository.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          We&apos;ve used Rust for these examples because Rust is the only language for which we have all three:
          Story, Bites, and Repositories.  C++ has a story and Repositories.  For C# there are only a few repositories.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          Eventually I expect that all three will have all of these things.
        </t-b>

          <hr />
          <t-b>
            This site focuses on three programming languages: C++, Rust, and C#, with emphesis on the first two.
            Content tracks are provided, from the top menu, for basic background information, and for each of the three languages.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Both C++ and Rust are important system programming languages that compile to native code.
            They give you tools to build quick and reliable systems and user applications.
            Rust provides reliability with compiler enforcements. C++ does that with conventions and helper types.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            C# is a managed language, deeply integrated with the dotnet framework and, like C++ and Rust, can run on Windows, Linux, and
            MacOS. At this time,
            C# coverage in this site is shallow, consisting of several code repositories.  Eventually that will be
            augmented by a C# Story and Bites.

            The tracks provide information suitable for developers, for reference or to start learning about one
            of these languages.  Stories and Bites cover most of the features of C++ and Rust, and
            materials for C# are being developed too.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Discussions are quite complete, but accompanied with diagrams and code examples to make the learning process
            fairly painless. There are also coding exercises at the end of most story chapters and many of the Bites.

      I retired in 2019 and have since been working mostly with the Rust language, but also in C++, with a little
      Python and C# thrown in. That work is featured in Tracks developed for this new site.

      The second purpose is to experiment with ways to present code, diagrams, text discussion, images
      and charts.  All vie for page real estate and what is most important to a user may vary over time.
      So the site needs to manage size and placement in ways that gracefully evolve with user actions and
      viewport size.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Site design is concerned with how to provide
      quick access to important code fragments as well as an entire product with multiple packages,  how to
      balance browser view space between non-trivial text descriptions, code examples, diagrams, and images,  and how to provide
      intuitive navigation through large collections of code and resources.

      The Rust community has crafted a number of high quality ebooks and web pages.  Here are three that are
      especially effective.

      Some parts of this site have broader focus than a single language.
      Basic Bites introduces simple models for platform, program, and object behaviors.
      Idioms &amp; Patterns compares
      small code examples written in C++, Rust, and C#.  Tooling helps you get started with language
      tools so you can start building code quickly.  Finally,
      Software Development deals with the engineering side of project construction.

      There are a lot of programming and language reference materials here. For now, language references focus
      on C++ and Rust, but eventually the site may add references for C#, and a few other languages.

      Here are places to look for language support:

          The Stories dropdown has C++ and Rust story tutorials.  Eventually there will be other language
          stories as well.
