Elements A ... F have style display:inline
so layout flows left to right.

Parent and Siblings have style display:block
so layout flows top to bottom.

Child is declared inside Parent, so starts 
there in flow order, but is not bound to
display only inside Parent.

Divs flow top-to-bottom with no spaces 
unless they have margin styling.
