        These Bites are a linked series of web pages hosting presentations about the Python
        programming language. They are intended to ease entry into the craft
        of writing Python.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Each Bite provides an introduction to, and discusses the ideas behind, some
        aspect of the language.  A menu on this page (lower right - Pages) shows the things we will be
        covering in this sequence.
      </t-b>
      <!--<t-b>
  Each Bite:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Consists of a few sections - typically three or four.
    </li>
    <li>
      Will focus on one part of the C++ language.
    </li>
    <li>
      May provide links into more detailed discussion, often in the

        Python is a relatively small and simple imperative language with effective standard library
        and many third-party libraries in many domains. 
        It is interpreted and supports object oriented design with an uncluttered syntax.
      </t-b> 
      <t-b>
        Its types are all dynamic, e.g., defined at
        run-time, so there is no static program analysis before execution.
        That means that most errors are found by exceptions thrown when the translator
        cannot correctly interpret a function. 
      </t-b>

        <hr />
        <ul>
          <li>
            All data types are references into data stored in a managed heap. That means that 
            assignments assign handles, not data instances, so an assignment results in two 
            handles pointing to the same data instance.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Python standard library provides a deepcopy function that will make a new instance 
            returned as an independent entity of the assignment source. Note that requires traversing 
            and copying an object graph that could be quite large, and so may be an expensive operation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python has a relatively simple syntax that defines scope by source white-space indentation. 
            A lot of its power comes from a substantial collection of standard and user-defined libraries.

        Figures 1, 2, and 3 provide a sample of
        how Python code is structured. Figure 1. holds some of the code for a Point class definition.
        Figure 2 shows how using code creates and uses instances of the class, and Figure 3 displays the output
        when the code in Figure 2 runs.

        In order to implement template functionality, C++ has created a compile-time functional language, use
        of which is called TemplateMetaProgramming, since TMP creates code at compile-Time.

          C++ is very fast because it compiles to native code, does not use garbage collection, and much
          of its syntax and semantics are designed to operate as efficiently as is practical.
        </li>
        <li>
          It has strong static typing so syntax errors are evaluated at compile-time, not run-time as in
          dynamically typed languages.
        </li>
        <li>
          The language has a moderately large <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">syntax footprint</a> and
          a large collection of
          standard libraries. So you can find ways within the language to meet your implementation goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is widely used - a lot of currently running applications have been built with C++,
          there are many experienced developers with C++ expertise, and the tooling has been refined
          for years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many third party libraries exist for math and scientific programming, graphics, games, databases, ...
        </li>
        <li>
          There are many sources of learning and reference material in the open literature.  This site

          C++ is a very complex programming language. Much of its complexity is due to context dependencies.

            <ol>
              <li>
                The keyword &quot;static&quot; means three different things, depending on its context:
                <ul style="margin-left:02rem;">
                  <li>
                    As qualifier in a variable declaration in namespace or block scope,
                    it means the variable is placed in static memory and has
                    lifetime of its enclosing program. The variable is only initialized once, even if declaration
                    occurs repeatedly in the program execution flow, and the variable is only visible in
                    the scope in which it is defined.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A static method can access only static member data, and is used with &quot;::&quot; instead
                    of the &quot;.&quot; operator.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A static member variable has a single, possibly mutable, value that is shared by all instances of its class.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Operations like construction and assignment may copy the source or may move ownership of the
                source&apos;s resources to the target.
                Which depends on whether the source is a temporary or a named entity or if
                the operation is in a context where return value optimization (RVO) applies.
              </li>
              <li>
                The rules for type deduction depend on whether the type is templated or not. And some of
                the rules are far from obvious.
              </li>
              <li>
                C++ provides strong, but not strict, static typing. The types of data can be modified at
                run-time through the use of casts; and many type conversions are made implicitly.  That
                can make analysis of program operation more difficult and lead to some surprising results.
              </li>
              <li>
                The special methods you implement for a class - see below - depend on the types of its data members.
                And the compiler allows you, without warning, to fail to implement them when you should.
              </li>
              <li>
                and the list goes on ...

          The language has a moderately large <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">syntax footprint</a> and
          a large collection of
          standard libraries. So you have to invest a lot of effort and years of experience to use
          most of it effectively.

          There are many paths to undefined behavior, e.g., reading and writing to memory the program does not
          own. Here&apos;s a <a href="../RustBites/RustBites_UDB.html">demonstration</a>.

      <h3 id="syntax">A Taste of C++ Syntax</h3>
      <t-b>
        C++ classes have a number of special methods.  For a class X:
        <ul>
          <li>
            X(), X(const &X), X(&&X), and X(T)<br />
            are default, copy, move, and promotion constructors
          </li>
          <li>
            X&amp; operator=(const &X) and X&amp; operator=(&&X)<br />
            are copy and move assignment operators.
          </li>
          <li>
            T&amp; operator[](size_t i) and T operator[](size_t i) const<br />
            are index operators for mutable and const instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            ~X() is the class instance destructor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Most of these the compiler will generate for you using member and base wise operations on
        the class&apos;s members and base classes.  For certain types of members,
        like primitives and containers from the Standard Template Library (STL), that
        works well, but if the class has pointer or lock members, the designer must provide
        most of them, as the compiler generated methods will be incorrect.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        These are the most common special methods but there are several others including
        arithmetic operators for contexts where that makes sense.
      </t-b>
      <h3 id="STR">STR Class</h3>
      <t-b>
        Implementation of all these methods is illustrated with the <a href="../../STRCode.html">STR class</a>.
        STR is a custom string class, not the std::string class. I wrote STR before there was a std::string
        class.  You should use the std::string in your code, but STR serves as a very nice concrete presentation
        of how the special C++ methods can be implemented.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        All of this will be discussed in more detail, with examples, in the following bites.
