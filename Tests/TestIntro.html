  <h2>Test Introduction</h2>
  <tm-b>
    These pages show test results for techniques for this site. Some have been incorporated 
    into the site, some have been saved and disclosed as snippets that may be useful at some 
    later time.  
  </tm-b>
  <t-b>
    They are shown without much explanation. They've explored ideas to see what 
    works. Some have been rejected and some have led to implementations that are an 
    integral part of the site.
  </t-b>
  <t-b>
    To explore design and implementation of a test, open the test page, right-click, 
    and select: 
    <inset>
      <code>This Frame > View Frame Source</code>
    </inset>
    Any of the included stylesheets and 
    scripts can be opened by clicking on links for those in the Source.
  </t-b>
  <t-b>
    Some of the test ideas that appeared to be useful for site operations 
    have been developed into components and explained in much more detail. You 
    will find them in the &quot;Components&quot; list available from the left 
    panel of this view.
